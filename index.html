                <p>
                    Jhemm Fighters requires two people to play. You and your opponent will each choose a class from The Silent, The Brawn, or The Caster. Each class will have different abilities and stats that will affect your gameplay. After you create your characters it will take you to an interim screen that will tell you who gets to choose there move next. Your attack choices will provide a hit chance, the lower this number the better. Your defense choices will provide a defense rating, the higher this number the better. The attacked will randomly roll a number between 1 and 10, if this number is equal to or greater than the hit chance and defense rating added together you will hit your opponent and deal damage! Don't forget to keep an eye on your energy, you can only choose the action if you have the energy available. You will continue this process until one of the participants reaches 0 HP. Now get out there and defeat your opponent!

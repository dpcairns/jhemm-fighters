                    Welcome to Jhemm Fighters! Two players, one device, and plenty of implied fantasy violence!
                </p>
                
                <h2>How to play</h2>
                
                <p>
                    Jhemm Fighters requires two people to play. Each round of gameplay consists of four turns and two battles, and each player makes one offensive and one defensive move before the end of a round. The game will cycle through rounds until one of the participants reaches 0 HP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each player creates their own character, and may choose to play as either The Silent, The Brawn, or The Caster. Each class has different abilities and stats that affect gameplay. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After you create your characters, the game will direct you to an interim page, and randomly pick one player to make the first action. At this point, the device should be passed to the designated player, who will choose their first action in secret. Once they've submitted their choice, the other player will be prompted to do the same. After both actions have been chosen, the game will execute the battle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your attack choices will provide a hit chance -- the lower this number the better. Your defense choices will provide a defense rating -- the higher this number the better. The attacker will randomly roll a number between 1 and 10; if this number is equal to or greater than the hit chance and defense rating added together, they will hit their opponent and deal damage! Don't forget to keep an eye on energy, as you can only choose an action if you have enough energy available.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alright, let's rumble!

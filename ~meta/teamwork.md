# Teamwork meta

## Communications

- In event of cross-talk, "point of order"
- Patience with realities of video calling
- Mindfulness about opportunities for speaking -- prompting for input from all teammates, etc.
- Slack to communicate off-Zoom
- Proactive communication about availability, concerns, etc.

### In case of conflict...

- Vote to decide on "regular" disagreements
- For highly consequential disagreements or if de-escalation is needed, reach out to TAs for mediation
    - Clarifying intentions & positions
    - Clarifying common project goals
